# Crypto Tracker

This project is a simple client-side crypto tracking website built only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to register, login and manage a list of favourite cryptocurrencies. The main interface provides modules for viewing price history and trending news using the CoinGecko API.

## Getting Started

Open `login.html` in a browser to create an account or login. After authentication you will be redirected to `index.html` where you can add favourite coins and load different modules.

All data is stored in `localStorage` so no server is required.
